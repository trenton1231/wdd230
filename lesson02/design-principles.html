            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <a class="links" href="https://www.target.com">Target</a>
            <p>Target uses the principle of repetition very well.
                Throughout the site, you can see the iconic red ball used
                in various fashions and instantly know that you must be on
                Target's website. With the use of red repeated throughout
                the website, your are further constantly reminded that you are on Target's website.</p>

            <p>The first thing you see upon loading Apple's website is their
                newest product for this year. It is the most important thing
                and what they assume most people will be looking for. The name
                of said product is next, and finally their catchy phrase for
                whatever product it is this time around. Everything about that
                product is accessible by clicking on the biggest part of the
                website, the products photo. They've done a fantastic job at
                setting up visual hierarchy in my opinion.</p>

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <a class="links" href="">BestBuy</a>
            <p>
                Overall, BestBuy has done a pretty good job of following Hick's Law.
                While there are a lot of choices, they are given to you slowly
                in an effort to reduce the overwhelming options when it comes to
                various electronics and the choices that a consumer has with them.
                I searched for televisions and while I was given the option to pick
                everything I was filtering for, I was also shown a nice selection of
                sizes to start at. From there, I was able to filter much less options
                based on the size of potential television I wanted.
